      a legal contractbetween you (the company)
      and the user. 
      It’s where you 
      maintain your rights to exclude users from 
      your app in the event that they abuse your 
      website/app, set out the rules for 
      using your service and note other important 
      details and disclaimers.
      Having a Terms and Conditions agreement is 
      completely optional. No laws require you to 
      have one. Not even the super-strict and 
      wide-reaching General Data Protection 
      Regulation (GDPR).
      Your Terms and Conditions agreement will 
      be uniquely yours. While some clauses are 
      standard and commonly seen in pretty much 
      every Terms and Conditions agreement, it’s 
      up to you to set the rules and guidelines that
       the user must agree to.
      Terms and Conditions agreements are also
      known as Terms of Service or Terms of Use 
      agreements. These terms are 
      interchangeable, practically speaking. 
      More rarely, it may be called something like 
      an End User Services Agreement (EUSA).'''),
